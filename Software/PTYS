The drivers have been modified and added to support ptys, pseudo ttys.
If in sysconfig.h  PTTY=1 is set, the kernel build will support the new
pty master and slave devices.

ptys are assigned ABOVE the last physical tty port in your system, but
the first pty will be /dev/tty05, even if you have only the console port.

I have set the max for ptys at 8.

ptyinfo is the tools that helps you to know which /dev/ttyxx entries are
ptys.

++ ptyinfo
First pty master: /dev/tty05, first pty slave: /dev/ptys05, # of ptys: 8

Here it is shown that in this hardware system the first pty master is
/dev/tty05 and the corresponding slave device is /dev/ptys05. As up to 8
ptys are supported, the highest pty master is /dev/tty12 and the highest 
pty slave is /dev/ptys12.

crw-r-- 1 root     15,  8 Nov 29 13:16 /dev/ptys08  <<== pty slave

/dev/ptys0  is used for control and can't be used as a pty.

What is a pty? It is a software terminal device.

shell <->  /dev/tty05<------->/dev/ttys05 <-> ptyserv <-> netclient on PC

if /etc/ttylist has the entry for /dev/tty05 set as: + 05:ans4::  ,init will
start a login on /dev/tty05. So at the other end, the netclient on the PC is
presented with the login screen as if it was on the hardware terminal.

Login: 

The user can login the normal way now. The special thing is that all the 
'ttyset' settings apply here. If you do  'ttyset +case', the ouput from
UniFLEX is done in all uppercase!

ptyserv is a utility that can connect to a pty slave device on UniFLEX and
present that at the network with a choosen port.

ptyserv -d /dev/ptys05 -p 12345

From a PC you can run  ufclient <IP_of UniFLEX> 12345 

and the data is presented.

When the ptysxx side is closed, a 'hangup' interrupt is sent to all processes
connected to the corresponding master port. One result is that the shell logs out.
