1/15/85?? - Version 1.1 (IOP)  Fixed the routine "int_all" which interrupts all tasks on  a given terminal.  This fixed some problems associated with  typing control-C, etc.  Also, the auto-sizing code did not work properly for more  than 20 terminals.2/17/85 - Version 1.2  Fixed a timing problem involved in control-C aborts (they  are difficult, aren't they?).  In this case, a task was  processing a "request for space" transaction and got interrupted  by the "interrupt all tasks on this terminal" transaction.  Interrupts were only being honored when the task went to  sleep and in this case were ignored.  Thus you ended up  with some space pre-sold for a terminal and the associated  user of the space (on the UniFLEX end) was blown away.  Depending  on the buffer sizes, this could lock the terminal up permanently.
