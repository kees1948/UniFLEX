posted new source tree. It contains the first version of ./gen_cpu. This directory
holds all common files for IOP/UIO and Network.
In the kernel and network, the interface over the 'fio' has been changed in a more
generic way. As it it now, all the code in ./gen_cpu is run without any knowledge
of the underlying hardware environment.

The UIO code has not yet been adapated to this but will be soon and than it will be
more useable.

The network ROM code has undergone improvements on handling faults and errors.  
*** You _should_ use the NEW kernel code with the new IOP/Network rom! ***

Older kernels work with the newer network rom for the most, but some interactions WILL fail.
