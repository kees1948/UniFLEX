It will* in a round robin fashion, all runable tasks make* one run. This way there will be no priority clash* between the active sockets*** rsched** Rsched will reschedule the cpu giving control to* another ready task.  If no tasks are ready,* looping is done until one becomes ready.  Rsched* does not put the current task back on the ready list!* This routine returns one to the caller.  All registers* are destroyed.*rsched    seti    mask       interrupts*rsched2   clri          nop          seti          bsr     stptsk     select next task in chain          bsr     gtsktb     get it's details** is it runnable?*          lda     tsstat,x   ready?          cmpa    #TRUN          bne     rsched2    no?, try the next one*          bsr     swtchu     switch users top page          rts     return** select next task*gtsktb    pshs    d             current index          ldx     #tsktab       task table          ldb     tskindx          lda     #TSKSIZ          mul          leax    d,x           select task          puls    d,pc** step index in tasks list*stptsk    pshs  a          lda   tskindx         step index          inca          cmpa  NUM_TSK          blo   01f             against max          clra01        sta   tskindx          puls  a,pc** Switch users*   X - Task entry for new task*swtchu    puls    y          get return address          stx     utask      set up new running task          lds     umark0,x   reset stack          jmp     0,y        return to caller          pag** makrdy** Make a task ready to run.
