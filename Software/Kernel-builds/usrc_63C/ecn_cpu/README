All code in this directory is highly experimental

ecnadlc.t       is the MC68B54 driver with a lot a error tests and exit.
                Especially exit on DCD and CTS status is included.
                While in the 'read' loop and before any data arrived,
                setting the external 'extabt' flag, makes it drop out
                the wait-for-data loop and exit.

With a small modification on the first edition hardware, the collision
detection works far better and will abort a transmission immediately.

My feeling is that, the original EcoNet(r) did not handle collisions very well
if I look at their hardware designs, I used these as a guide for the 09ECN
board.

ecnadclc.t.01 and ecnadlc.t.02 are earlier versions of the driver code but lack
error exit at some places.

I have tested the ecoadlc.t cde quite extensively with two boards starting to
transmit about the same time, they abort within a few bits where the earlier
driver code (and hardware) did not detect the collision at all.
