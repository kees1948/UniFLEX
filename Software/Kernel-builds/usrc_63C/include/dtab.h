 pag** Device table** The device table is a structure required by each* block device.  It contains two sets of list* headers, plus a device busy flag, and error retry* count.  The list headers are the same as in the* buffer headers.  One points to the list of buffers* currently associated with the device while the* other one may be used by the dvice driver as the* io queue header.** struct dtab base 0dtdfl rmb 2 device buffer list fwd linkdtdbl rmb 2 device buffer list back linkdtqfl rmb 2 device io queue fwd linkdtqbl rmb 2 device io queue back linkdtbusy rmb 1 device busy flagdtrtry rmb 1 device error retry countdtspr rmb 2 device spare bytes (future use)DVTSIZ equ * device table size
