ENVIRONMENT 

UniFLEX 6x09 never had an enviroment fascility. For various reasons, TSC decided
to leave that out in the 6x09 versions of their UnIFLEX.

While I found little requirement for it in all the years, there maybe situations
where having such is beneficial.

So I made that functionality available in a, bit of emulating, way.

prerequites for this to work:

* the password file should have an entry for the user, with ID and path to home directory.
* an '.ENVIRON' file in the user home directory with permissions -rw----- or -r------ at most
  end it should be owned by the user. (if the prerequisite requirements are not met, NULL is
  returned!)
and/or
* a '.ENVIRON' file in the _current_ directory but all the requirements remain.

The contents of the .ENVIRON file can be edited at will. The structure is always:

<name>=<value>    where <name> is most likely something useful, i.e. "home". The <value>
is a number or string.

USER=kees
HOME=/home/kees
SHELL=/bin/shell
LINES=40

Any C program now can do getenv("SHELL") and the function returns "/bin/shell". It is advised
to put <name> in capitals.

There is a restriction imposed on the user home directory pathname length, 61 chars.
The is also a restriction on the maximum length of one line in .ENVIRON, keep it below 256.
