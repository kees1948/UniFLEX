Here some tools that should run on a Linux (PC) platform.

===============================================================
'ufclient.c' is a simple telnet client that I found. All the
offical telnet clients gave problems, must notably with the
handling of ^C.

In  ufclient.c , I only disabled the negotiation at startup.
On my Linux PC it is a perfect tool.
