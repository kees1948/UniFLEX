                MODIFICATION GoTek with ST32F105/AT32F415

Create S2:
	Cut the trace between MO and P1 pin-16
	Connect the MO jumper to P1 pin-14
	MO jumper is now drive select S2.

Create new MO:
	Glue a single DIP switch next to the MO jumper.
	Connect one side to P1 pin-16
	Connect other side with a 1K pullup to +5V and a wire:
          - for the STM32F105 pin-36 (U8 SPI footprint pin-5).
          - for the AT32F415 pin-26 (U8 SPI footprint pin-5).




                MODIFICATION GoTek with AT32F435

MO from J1 is now connected with the AT32F435.

Create S2:
      (Top435)
        Cut the trace between MO and P1 pin-16
        Connect P1 pin-16 to resistor PU14
     (Bottom435)
        Cut the trace from jumper block to AT32F435
        Connect the MO jumper to P1 pin-14
        Wire MO to S1

      MO jumper is now drive select S2.
