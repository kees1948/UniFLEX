Our UniFLEX member Kees de Jong has put much effort and spent
quite some time in scanning and filing much (if not all) of the
documentation he posesses.

>>>>> We owe him much rewards and thanks for that. <<<<<

He allowed me to put all that material on the GitHub archive too.

Kees (the other one) :-)
