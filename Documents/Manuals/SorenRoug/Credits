I have to admit that I don't look at the 'issues' tab on GitHub that often. 
Recently I noticed that Soren Roug had dropped a notice that he had more
UniFLEX doc's and manuals. I was allowed to copy them to my GitHub archive,
for which I owe him many thanks.

Some of the manuals are duplicates from others
