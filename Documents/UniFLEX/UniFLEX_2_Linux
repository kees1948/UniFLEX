Very recently I played (successfuly) with diskette exchange
between UniFLEX and Linux

* On UniFLEX I have the GPP/09FLP hardware with drive(s) connected

* On Linux I have an USB floppy drive, 'dmesg' reports it as /dev/sdc

The Linux user is member of the 'disk' group. (if not you should make him/her so)

Linux:

as sudo:    ln -s /dev/sdc  /dev/fd0

ufiformat  /dev/fd0         (use a diskette with 2 holes, high density)
this should end  with reporting 1440 blocks  (1K each)

UniFLEX:

format a diskette  (high density, 2 holes)

formatfd +d/dev/fd0 +S +r10 +m=F3-DD80

this results in an AT compatible disk format, non biased sectors at side 1 !!!

mount this diskette

put data on it

umount diskette

check with diskrepair that the structure is good


move this diskette over to the USB drive on Linux

dd if=/dev/fd0 of=imagename bs=512          this creates an image file of this diskette
I have uploaded uf_fl_boot.img, this is a BOOTABLE floppy image!! in this folder.

alternatively

fuse_uf /dev/fd0  directory (mountpoint)

now ls -lR directory shows all your UniFLEX data and files
with cp you can transfer files, to Linux no restriction, from Linux ONE FILE AT A TIME!!
fuse_uf has not been setup for concurrent access.

fusermount -u directory    unmounts the image

create UniFLEX compatible diskette on Linux:

ufiformat /dev/fd0                              raw format
makeuffs -b 2880 -s 360 -f /dev/fd0 -F 1381     creates an empty filesystem

The pattern for the -F option are taken from 'disk_formats.ods', here the 
80 tracks, 18 sectors per track, high density, UNBIASED sectors. This option
is VERY important as UniFLEX uses this information to set the floppy driver
properly!


This creates a diskette that also has swap space allocated.


create UniFLEX boot diskette:

On Linux:

ufiformat  /dev/fd0  
this should end  with reporting 1440 blocks  (1K each)

dd of=/dev/fd0 if=uf_fl_boot.img bs=512

this MUST end with no errors, otherwise try other diskette

when finished you have a UniFLEX diskette that you can boot from with 'F'
