Structure of a UniFLEX disk 

UniFLEX considers a disk as a collection of blocks, each 512 byte in size/

===================================================================================
Block 0 contains the IPL code, this code is brought into RAM by the ROM code.
        When started it will (attempt) to load the kernel into memory and start it.

The bootloader code loads de target file BY NAME, it should reside in the root
directory of the boot partition. Depending on settings in the booted image, the
root/pipe/swap device may be defined individually. So you can boot from floppy but
further work from a harddisk.

===================================================================================        
Block 1 contains the SIR. System Information Record. It contains all the vital
        information about the disk image.

Items found in the SIR are among a lot others:

scrtim  creation time
sutime  last update time
sszfdn  size in blocks of fdn list
ssizfr  size in blocks of volume
sfreec  total free blocks
sfdnc   free fdn count
sfname  file system name
spname  file system pack name
sfnumb  file system number
sswpbg  swap starting block number
sswpsz  swap block count

===================================================================================
Block 2 is the first FDN block. In the SIR is the size of the FDN blocks found
        in 'sszfdn'. Each FDN block holds 8 FDN's.
        
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Block 1+sszfdn  first DATA block of the image. This block holds the root directory
                of the image. 
                
The DATA blocks area holds also blocks with the free-block list spread out over it.

The last DATA block is indicated with 'ssizfr' in the SIR.

After this the SWAP space is allocated (or not). The start of the SWAp space
is indicated by 'sswpbg' in the SIR, where 'sswpsz' is the total blocks set
aside for the space space.

So, if the disk is 'partitioned', the next image could start after
'ssizfr' +'sswpsz' blocks.

Look into 'sir.h' in the include directory of the kernel source.

An FDN holds information about a file. If it is a normal file, directory
or device, together with the access bits, file owner ID.
Also the size, last modification timestamp is stored in it.
Lastly the blocks, direct and indirect are found in the fdn.

A directory is in principle a file with fixed size entries.
Each entry consists of a 16 bit FDN identifier followed by 14 characters
for the filename.
