As the CPU09MM3 card has hardware that detects whether the CPU is running in 68X09 mode
or in 63X09 mode. The principle of the circuit is very simple: record all consequetive 
write cycles in a counter and reset the counter when a new write starts. That works well
because R/W is a status and is kept low during all write cycles.

Now hold that count when in kernel mode. To enter kernel mode a process or hardware needs
to generate an interrupt. All registers will be stacked before the interrupt vector is
fetched. Fetching the interrupt enters system state which freezes the counter. Now the code
in the UniBUG ROM can read the value and save it in the user data area. The kernel is always
running in 63X09 mode. On return, the saved counter value is tested and the proper CPU mode
is restored on return from the interrupt.

That method proves to be soldi and reliable. When a user process alters the CPU mode by itself
the kernel will act accordingly. The kernel also sets the CPU for 'long' FIRQ stackframes.
Of course a user process can meddle with this setting too, but only this process will be the
victim of that, it will be terminated.

Of cource the UniFLEX kernel code had to be adapted for this, I believe I did all that well.
I choose for that a process is always launched in 63x09 mode but the application code may 
change the CPU mode when it starts running.

One of the direct results of this is: now I can run OS9 level I as an UniFLEX process!
The OS9 kernel code as I got it is 68x09 based and would not run in 63x09 mode.
I modified the startup code and as soon as it starts it switches back to 68x09 mode and
the OS9 kernel works. In '86 I had already created drivers for UniFLEX as OS9 modules.

-       ******  WELCOME TO OS-9  ******
-
-   The OS-9 operating system has many capabilities beyond the
-   ordinary operating system.  You should try to become familiar
-   with these innovations.
-
-   To start with attempt just a simple Dir command.  Then you
-   might try Dir /d0/cmds to display all commands.  You will see
-   that this disk has hierarchical directories as described
-   on page 16 of the user's guide.  Another vital part of OS-9
-   to understand is working directories as described on page 20.
-   Note also that this startup file can be altered, or deleted
-   and a new one created.

-      ******      HAVE FUN      ******
-
-   Uniflex users will detect a great degradation in comfort
-   because the Shell does NOT expand any wild cards.
-   Further when copying something to another directory the
-   whole destination pathname, including the destination
-   filename, must be given.

I have been playing with the MONitor board and more specifically the RAM chips on it.
I removed both 512Kx8 chips from the board and placed one 128Kx8. Initially it would NOT work,
that is odd, I expected it to work without problem. But comparing datasheets proved that, where
the 512Kx8 has A17, the 128Kx8 has CS2. So that needs some intervention. I left pin 30 out of 
the socket and put a thin wire between pin 30 and pin 32 on the chip. Now it works! 
UniBUG is clever enough to map out any mirror RAM so it reports correctly 128K.
UniFLEX boots, but is hampered by the low RAM. Diskrepair will not run. The kernel eats 36K, system buffers 32K, 
init eats 12K and a shell eats another 40K.

All of a sudden te system starting to react weird. It would not boot when I had a CPU09GPP board in the backplane.
It would boot up uniflex9 with a TRAP at the end. Sometimes it booted normal and 'sort of appeared to work'.
Hooked up the logic analyzer, I noticed that the /XFEXX signal went low some cycles _after_ the
vector was fetched and the hardware was in system mode. This caused the CPU to skip the first bytes of
the interrupt handler code. Checked GAL's but nothing strange was found.
Looked at the signals /SYS and /B_SYS, they came at the right moment. Checked /syst, hey that one was
delayed by one cycle. As /syst is coming OR-ed from /SYS and /B_SYS via te 74HC132 a suspected this IC.
Replaced the 74HC132 and all strange effects were gone! The pin 1 input stopped working,
It took me a few hours of checking and thinking before I understood the situation fully.

I took the rm.c source from a Unix V7 source archive on the Internet. After some adaptations for the 
McCosh compiler it compiled without errors. The resulting 'rm' utility appears to work well and des
also recursive remove, that is a real advantage. In the coming weeks I will check if everything
works as intended.

The same went for 'touch.c'. That compiled right away and can create 0 byte files when it does not yet
exist, something the TSC version could not. As creating empty (flag) files happen quite often I am
happy that I have a version that does it right.

I realized that I missed this one for quite some time. Most items are documented elsewhere on this pages.

* latest UniBUG version is unibug_d. has netboot function and adapted memory tables for the upcoming
videoboard.

* have replaced mount and unmount by a C version that also updates /etc/mtab

* has replaced 'touch' by the C version, it now also creates an empty file when it is not there

* has replaced 'login' by a newer C version, as the date was chown incorrectly

* has created a 'loop' device driver, this allows for a disk file image to be accessed as it
was a block device. 'losetup' is the controlling tool.

* has created a 'pty' driver. This driver provides 'pseudo ttys'. They make it easy for networking
connections to connect to local processes. Also one can have communication channels between unrelated processes

* has created a floppy disk interface. With a CPU09GPP and a 09FLP board. Drivers are capable of
supporting almost all formats automatically. The formatting program has many options and supports
many disk layouts.

* networking has been added to the system. TCP/IP that is, the kernel has been extended with socket
calls for socket(), connect(), bind(), listen(), accept(), recvfrom() and sendto(). read() and write()
and close() use the standard kernel code. The sockets can be opened in TCP, UDP or IPRAW mode.
The socket calls as available in C has the same interface as the Berkely sockets!
Additional features are non-blocking or automatic EOL char translation.
The hardware consists of a CP09GPP and 09 NET board.

* new utilities are added: ifconfig, netstat, rasock, wasock, nettime, tcpserver and many more.

* a ptyserv(er) has been created, this allows 'pty's to be present as a port on the network. A 
telnet client version is now very well capable of connecting to UniFLEX over the network.

* a netblock device has been created, 'netblk'. This allows a remote server forwarding a partition
or a diskfile image to be presented and the local system can access it as a local block device

* the system allows for different block device MAJORS now, the 'read-ahead' code has been debugged
so that it all works now.

* the kernel source has been adapted to HD63x09 code where it was logically to do so.

* updated the 'clib.l' for a few functions, as the original code had flaws.
    : replaced scanf, it would not parse octal values properly
    : replaced ungetc, the original function did not work
    : added networking functions
    : added getopt
Now we have a properly working 'tar. The networking functions parse correctly.
