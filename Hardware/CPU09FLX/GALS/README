Atmel contains the specifications for the Atmel ATF22V10 & ATF16V8 chips.

Translated from PALASM to CUPL. 


Check the 'CPU09FLX_GAL_Table' to make a selection.


After programming there is a question?
Does the fuse table do what it is programmed to do?

In the TL866II+, import from Vector the .lgc files in the 'Logic IC Test' screen 
and Test the chip!
See "Vector test info" for the LGC files.

Works for GAL...., ATF.... and PALCE... chips, even with the LOCK BIT on.
You can even test with a 5V or 3.3V supply.


Comments:

   The TL866II+ vector table can only handle 512 lines.
   Chips with many inputs must therefore be tested in parts
   and with a 'don't care' on inputs that are not used in the function under test.

   The test items are indicated with -P1, -P2 etc.
   If there is no -Px after the GAL name, it is a full test.
