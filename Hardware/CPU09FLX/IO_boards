The CPU09FLX board has the same IO-bus connector as the CPU09GPP. Consequently, the IO boards
as found in the CPU09GPP directory are also suitable for use with the CPU09FLX board.

For some purposes it is perfectly possible to populate the CPU09FLX board with minimal
components.

If the IO board is a 09FLP or a 09ECN and you don't have few or none other IO hardware
in use, the CPU09FLX board may _only_ have the data buffer (74HC245) and a few wires.
The photo's 'miminal' and 'minimal_read' reflect the wiring. The board select wire
run from the bus A3 pin which reflects DIV#5. This results in that the IO board
placed on the IO expansion connector covers, repeatedly, the whole address range from 
F100...F17F. Which is for simple systems not a problem. DIV#5 is an arbritrary choice,
and other select may be used.

2021-04-20:
The later board revision covers two enhancements: first, a hardware circuit for an
interval timer (with Interrupt), second, a removeable part that eases the connectors
for some IO expansion boards.

The original version is still very useable.
