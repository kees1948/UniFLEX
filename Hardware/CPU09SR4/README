Yeah, this board gave me headache's. Not because the design was that difficult but more about 'Murphy' struck a few times here.

My _third_ production attempt is now in the mail......

The board has four 63B50 ACIA's and for each an individual baudrate select: 38400/19200/9600/4800/2400/1200/600/300 baud.
Each port has an MAX233 chip for the RS232 interfacing. The baudrate latch also can activate /CTS in case hardware handshake
is not needed. The IO space for one board is $10, so you can apply a couple of those. You can use them on the UniFLEX side
as well on the IOP side. I would suggest the latter, as the IOP relieves the main CPU here from all the serial device interrupts.
It has one GAL which does everything what is needed.

I need to adapt the UniFLEX kernel drivers for the baudrate select. The same for the IOP code.

Today the latest revision (rev 0.8) of the board was in the mail. I have put the components on one and made the GAL.
I'm happy now, as everything works as designed. 4 ports with an baudrate select each. Finally!!! :-)

About Jumpers:
    J6
[o][o][o][o]
[o][o][o][o]
    J7
 A  B  C  D  (position)
    
They are for board select, where the board should appear in the address range. Assume we wired the /sel pin of the board
to DIV3 (F008-F07F). Jumpers are to be placed between the J6 and J7 strip, thus 4 max.

D  C  B  A     Address select   Where 'V' is jumper present and '-' jumper absent
V  V  V  V     XX00             should not be used on the main CPU side, conflicts with ACIA on MON board.
V  V  V  -     XX10
V  V  -  V     XX20
V  V  -  -     XX30
V  -  V  V     XX40
V  -  V  -     XX50
V  -  -  V     XX60
V  -  -  -     XX70
-  X  X  X     XX80...XXFF      only for use with the CPU09IOP board.


With the UniBug monitor it is easy to check if you did the right selection, e f000-f07f. You should see the
MONitor ACIA and the PIA and the ACIA's on the SR4 board(s).
