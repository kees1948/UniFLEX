CPUXXCMI

Provides:
Choice for processor: MC68B02 or MC68B09 (HD63C09)@ 2MHz busclocks
60 KByte of contineous RAM 0000...EFFF
Decoded IO space           F000...F3FF
Extra 1KByte RAM           F400...F7FF
2K ROM                     F800...FFFF
ACIA local console port    F004...F005
Baudrate generator  0K3...38K4 with 1.2288 MHz bus signal
IO decoding very simular (but not identical) to CPU09MON
On board user/system state hardware with LED
BUS input that disables on-board addressing, allows for external boards


Description:
The CPUXXCMI is intended as a stand-alone computer system. However as the data and 
addresslines are fully buffered, the system may be expanded with a (mini) back-plane
and other CPU09XXX IO modules.

A very simple, but complete, FLEX system can be achieved with:
CPUXXCMI, CPU09BP3, CPU09FLX(minimally populated) and a 09FLP. However it may not
support the use of 8" compatible DD disk formats as the CPU can not cope with this.

The CPU can be either a MC68X02 (MC6800 compatible) processor or a MC68X09 processor,
the CPU should have the internal clock generator circuitry.

It is possible to have both Monitor ROM versions (68X02/68X09) present in the ROM,
with a jumper the proper version can be selected.


The user/system state hardware allows for a solution where (only) an interrupt start
the system state. In this state full access to the top 4 KByte of the address range
is granted. After writing to the ROM address space ONE cycle in ROM remains (for RTI).
After that the user state is active and the top 4KByte becomes inaccessible, this
includes: ROM, I/O and RAM (IO buffer etc).

With a SWI handler in the Monitor ROM access to the console IO or disk IO can be 
achieved but no user program can interfere with system data.
