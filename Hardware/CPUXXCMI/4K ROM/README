                         Use of the CMIxxCPU with 2 x 4Kbyte ROM.
                               Selection with RA1 jumper J5.


See cpuxxcmi_memmap_4K_rom.pdf for the memory map.

Provides:
Choice for processor: MC68B02 or MC68B09 (HD63C09)@ 2..4MHz busclocks
56 KByte of contineous RAM 0000...DFFF
Decoded IO space           E000...E3FF
Extra 3KByte RAM           E400...EFFF
4K ROM                     F000...FFFF
ACIA local console port    E004...E005
Baudrate generator  0K3...38K4 with 1.2288 MHz bus signal
IO decoding very simular (but not identical) to CPU09MON
On board user/system state hardware with LED
BUS input that disables on-board addressing, allows for external boards

                    *** The modification. ***

Read "The 4K ROM modification.pdf".


There is a modified FLEX version see the github FLEX part.

All software must be set for:
                     FDC = $E100
                    ACIA = $E004
                 Monitor = $F000

The 4K ROM makes other operating systems possible, 
perhaps OS9 level 1.
         
Works at all speeds, but tested with 16MHz GAL modification.

13-06-2024 update GAL's for extra RAM to use CPU9RAM card
