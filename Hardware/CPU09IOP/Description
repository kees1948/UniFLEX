CPU09IOP

Provides:
Dedicated HD63C09 at 4 MHz busclock with no wait states
IO address region of 256 bytes
Can drive multiple CPU09SR4 boards on a separate backplane
Serial port interrupt off-load for main CPU
Extendable with other IO boards
32 KB of RAM
up to 16 KB of (E)(P()ROM
LED's that signal access from main CPU and IO access


Description:
The CPU09IOP has a 256 byte dual-port RAM interface with the main CPU.The upper two locations are postboxes with interrupt
generation when written. One is for main CPU to IOP CPU, the other is for IOP CPU to main CPU.
The 32KB of RAM holds all data structures, buffers and stack for the IOP. The IOP firmware is slightly over 4 KByte and
fit's easily in an 8KB (E)(P)ROM. The other socket is for a debug ROM.
The IOP drives the IO backplane via a 40 wire flatcable. An old IDE cable will fit nicely here. The max cable length is about 40 cm.
For UniFLEX a dedicated driver is available. The basic version allows up to 4 CPU09SR4 boards but this can be changed at will.

The firmware and driver has undergone long tests and is to be considered stable and very capable.

Connect on the backplane the pin DIV7 (C28) with /sel (C23) of the CPU09IOP board. The most likely slot for the CPU09IOP is the one
at the end of the back-plane. The links L1 and L2 should have a small wire between them. Their purpose is that, for debugging, 
you can interrupt the connection with ease. The IO connector will fit in a second backplane which has the CPU09SR4 boards. Make
sure that the bus connection C23 on is backplane is run through all sockets (it is not by default).The cardsel jumper should
be present and on the position away from the CY7C130. With the UniBUG monitor it can be verified that the region F200-F2FF
is appear as it is RAM.


Firmware for IOP:

The code that should go into the ROM on the CPU09IOP board is to be found in 
../iop_cpu directory in the UniFLEX kernel source code tree.

in ../mach_m1/sysconfig.h you need to set the IOP variable to '1' and build a new kernel to use the IOP.
