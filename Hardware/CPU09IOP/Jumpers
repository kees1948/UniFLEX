The CPU09IOP has a few jumpers.

/MRDY       L1,L2

These are merely just to be (wire) jumpers. They should be on.
Their whole purpose is that you can cut /mrdy to either CPU is case of
hardware problems, without need to cut traces.
The /MRDY signals are used at both sides for arbitration when but CPU's
attempt to _write_ to the _same_ dual port RAM location.


CARDSEL   

This jumper selects between IOP0 and IOP1, F200-F2FF and F300-F3FF
Only pins 1 and 2 of the header are actually used, pin 3 is a placeholder.
Pin 1 has a pullup and will be high when open, pin 2 is GND
Jumper on pin 2-3 or absent, select IOP1, F300-F3FF
Jumper on pin 1-2, select IOP0, F200-F2FF


GND, /NMI, VCC     J6

Can be used to apply a NMI on the local CPU. i.e. with the 09NMI board.
