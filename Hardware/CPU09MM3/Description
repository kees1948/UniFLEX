CPU09MM3

Provides:
* HD63C09 running at a 4 MHz busclock with no wait states
* 20 bit address, 8 bit data and all control lines, all full buffered
* a MMU which can hold up to 64 process maps at one time, context switching is setting a latch value
* Full kernel isolation, no user process can access or disrupt OS data
* Maximum per process memory space is 65024 bytes, only the upper 512 bytes are void. The CPU09 UniFLEX provides that too
* Full interrupt protection, no user process can disrupt the interrupts in the system
* DMA mode for specialized fast IO controllers
* a Supervisor/User state signal and status
* can (lightweight) detect and record the CPU mode on any Interrupt and restore that on RTI, with matching UniBUG code (63X09 v.s. 68X09)
* surpasses the SWTPC MPU-1 CPU board in features, as thus it runs UniFLEX-II and beyond 

Description:
This CPU card is driven by a HD63C09 running at 4 MHz bus clocks. The card has extra hardware for System/User state distinction,
a DATBOX that can hold the maps for up to 64 processes (each 16 x 4K), a task latch that can be set for the active task and
a single bit Kernel/Usertask selection. This results in a very efficient context switching. 3 22V10 GAL's are used for glue logic.
It has a timer that expires when interrupts stop coming and that will end the running task and recover the OS from it with _ALL_ 
the CPU registers saved. At last it has hardware to establish if the CPU entered the recent interrupt in 6309 or 6809 mode, 
so the OS can run in 6309 mode and if a user task modifies the CPU mode, the kernel can take correct action when an interrupt 
occurs. The card format is Eurocard (160x100mm) and has a DIN41612 a-c connector.

U6 = CPU, U8 = DATBOX(MMU), U17 = TASKLATCH, U9+U19 = STACKCOUNT, U13 = SYSTEM/USER , U18 = KERNEL/USER MAP U16 = INTERRUPT TIMEOUT,
U7 = RESET CIRCUIT/LOGIC, U10/U12/U14 = GAL LOGIC, U1/U2/U3/U4/U5 = BUS BUFFERS,

2019-10-11:  CPU09MM3 (Rev 1.0) board received, populated and tested. It runs smoothly. No anomalies found.

2019-11-26:  CPU09MM3 (Rev 1.0.1) errata: pin 1 U18 was dangling (at Rev 1.0). No effect noticed but it should be connected
to either pin 8 U7 (RSO-) (or to VCC). The UniBUG rom takes care of the proper state, but we don't want it inadvertently be
reset at the wrong moment.
