I use 2 IDE boards, the first for the harddisk, the second for SD<->IDE cards
and CF<->IDE cards.

I found that if you changed the card, when not in use, re-open the disk image
on it did hang the OS. That is not completely unexpected but a nuisance.

I tried a modification on the REV2.0 IDE card to see if things could be eased
a bit. And yes, it can. 

The L_CSEL output on the latch is unused, in software and in hardware, so I
re-used that output for a alternate (software) RESET on the IDE disk(s).
That worked quite satisfactory. The change is not complex.

Wire pin 12 of U10 to pin 16 of U7 (G2). Both are free pins.
Wire pin 21 of U7 to the via as shown on img_v2.0tov2.1a.jpg
Cut the trace as shown on img_v2.0tov2.1b.jpg 

Only left over is a change in the G2 Pal definition:
IDE_G2D.PDS
       Pin 16   CRES     ; input
       Pin 21   IDE_RES_ ; output

/IDE_RES_ = /IRES_ + CRES  ; reset IDE with system and software

fetch the new version of idedrvr.h and idedrvr.t from GitHub and build
your kernel with in. When running you may notice a very slight delay when
a disk is opened first time.

NOTE: a SD/SF card MUST BE PRESENT when opening the device, failing to do
so will hang the system.

ALSO: don't forget to u(n)mount _all_ SD/CF card partitions before taking 
it out to replace it. Failing to do so may severly damage the data
structures on the cards!!!


NB: the wire between pin 16 U10 and pin 9 U7 (G2) is for the serializing
of two CPU09IDE boards. 

On the bus, a wire should be present between C28 (BO) of the first IDE card
and A28 (BI) of the second CPU09IDE card.
