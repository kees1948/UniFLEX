Some months ago I made this little board. It fits in the 40 pole IDE connector
of the CPU09IDE board and accomodates 2 solid-state disk types:

* SD-card
* CF-card

For the CF-card it is essential that the interface supports DMA.

I added some photo's on 'how I did it'.

The (big) power connector for the SD-card interface sits aside of the sdadapt
board (with a bit stress). I removed it from my board.
The smaller power connector is accessible very well for both types of interface.

The connector for the CPU09IDE is 40 pole female.

The connector for the CF-card interface is 40 pole angled-male.

The connector for the SD-card interface is 40 pole female.
