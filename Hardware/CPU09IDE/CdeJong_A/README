I feel that the DC2 connectors have changed sizes a bit over the last 30 years.

Initially I used connectors from the junknox which dated back to the 80's.

But now I have new 'Nextron' connectors, I need to modify the 
'FLP small' description a bit as shown in the attached files here.

Also added improvements for the CPU09GPP and 09ECB combo.

At last, added the latest CPU09IDE modifications and GAL data for G2.
