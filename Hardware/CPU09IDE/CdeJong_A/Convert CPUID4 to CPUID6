Convert CPUID4 to CPUID6

First make the modifications V1.2 and V1.3

1)
TOP side:

cut trace pin-17 G4 between R5 and R6
cut trace pin-10 G4 between C7 and C10
cut trace pin-9  G2 between G2 and C13 (dual card mod.)

BOTTUM side:

cut trace pin-16 G2 between U2 and U10
cut trace pin-17 G2 between U2 and U10

cut trace pin-22 G3

wire pin-9  G2 to pin-16 U10 (dual card mod.)
wire pin-22 G3 to pin-3  G4
wire pin-8  G3 to pin-16 G4
wire pin-4  G3 to pin-13 G4

wire pin-15 G4 to pin-38 FC_40VF
wire pin-17 G4 to pin-37 FC_40VF

wire pin-28 FC_40VF to pin-30 FC_40VF

2)
remove R1 and R2 from gnd holes
wire R1 and R2 to Vcc C2
Or:
remove on TOP and BOTTUM gnd from the holes (5mm drill)
put R1 and R2 back in the holes
on BOTTUM side wire R1 and R2 to pin-14 U1.

3)
reprogram the 4 GAL's with IDE_GxB versions.

-

Dual CPU9IDE card:
reprogram G2 with IDE_G2C.JED

-

Optional add LED's:
drill holes next to R7 and R1, see the green O markers.
remove on TOP and BOTTUM gnd from the holes (5mm drill)
place R8 and R9 (use some glue) 
on BOTTUM side wire R8 and R9 to pin-14 U1

drill 4 holes for D1 and D2, See the green O markers.
remove on TOP and BOTTUM gnd from the holes (5mm drill)
place D1 and D2 (use some glue)
wire D1-a to R8
wire D2-a to R9
wire D1-k to pin-20 G1
wire D2-k to pin-7  G1

-

Optional add DACK- / ADEN- jumper:
cut trace, see V1.1 modification
glue a jumper on BOTTUM side next to FC-40VF
Or:
drill 3 holes, see the blue O markers.
remove on TOP and BOTTUM gnd from the holes (5mm drill)
glue a 3 pin jumper on the TOP side

wire pin-1 to the hole (DACK- trace)
wire pin-2 to pin-29 FC_40VF
wire pin-3 to pin-20 G1

2022-05-22 Adapted mod. by CS

I use 2 IDE boards, the first for the harddisk, the second for SD<->IDE cards and CF<->IDE cards.

I found that if you changed the card, when not in use, re-open the disk image
on it did hang the OS. That is not completely unexpected but a nuisance.

I tried a modification on the REV2.0 IDE card to see if things could be eased
a bit. And yes, it can. 

The L_CSEL output on the latch is unused, in software and in hardware,
so I re-used that output for a alternate (software) RESET on the IDE disk(s).
That worked quite satisfactory. The change is not complex.

Wire pin 12 of U10 to pin 16 of U7 (G2). Both are free pins.
Wire pin 21 of U7 to the via as shown on CPU9ID4v2.1_Bottum_Full.jpg
Cut the trace as shown on CPU9ID4V2.1_Top.jpg the black market cut.

Only left over is a change in the IDE_G2C.PDS Pal definition:
Pin 16   CRES     ; input
Pin 21   IDE_RES_ ; output

/IDE_RES_ = /IRES_ + CRES  ; reset IDE with system and software

reprogram G2 with IDE_G2D.JED

fetch the new version of idedrvr.h and idedrvr.t from GitHub and build
your kernel with in. When running you may notice a very slight delay when
a disk is opened first time.

NOTE: a SD/SF card MUST BE PRESENT when opening the device, failing to do
so will hang the system.

ALSO: don't forget to u(n)mount _all_ SD/CF card partitions before taking 
it out to replace it. Failing to do so may severly damage the data
structures on the cards!!!


NB: the wire between pin 16 U10 and pin 9 U7 (G2) is for the serializing
of two CPU09IDE boards. On the bus, a wire should be present between 
C28 (BO) of the first IDE card and A28 (BI) of the second CPU09IDE card.

Note:
Some wires are connected on Via holes to reduce crossings and shorten the wires.
