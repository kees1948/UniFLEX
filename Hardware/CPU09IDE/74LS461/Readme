          You can use a GAL to replace the 74LS461 chip.


Rule 1: If you can get the 74LS461, use it.

Rule 2: GAL Table number 2 entries.
        Direct replacement voor de CPU09IDE card 74LS461,
        but not a 100% functional 74LS461 version.



         Non direct replacement but 100% functional 74LS461.

GAL Table number 1 entries.
But now the Q7 and Q5 outputs are swapped, this is not a direct replacement.
Read the '74LS461 - GAL.pdf'.


USE rule 1 or 2.
