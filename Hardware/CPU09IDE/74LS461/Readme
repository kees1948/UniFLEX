          You can use a GAL to replace the 74LS461 chip.



     1: If you can get the 74LS461, * use it.
        

     2: GAL Table Rule 2 entries.
        Direct replacement voor de CPU09IDE card 74LS461 chip.




How it works:

Some explanation about the 74LS461 in a GAL.

A full 74LS461 implementation in a GAL needs too many 'terms' on Q5, Q6 and Q7.
Therefore, the Q outputs cannot be in the 74LS461 chip order.

HOWEVER on the CMIxxIDE pin-11 of the 74LS461 is connected to GND.
So all AND's with pin-11 low input, have no function and can be removed.
And all OR's with pin-11 high input, have no function and can be removed.
See the GALUx-461.PDS file and look at the /Q7 rule it says '; removed I1'.

This reduces the 'terms' count so that the GAL is pin compatible with the 74LS461.
The GAL is 100% FUNCTIONALLY COMPATIBLE with a 74LS461 on the CMIxxIDE.


!!! Please note that this GAL is only suitable as a replacement for the 74LS461 
    in any other system if pin-11 is connected to GND. !!!



This is not necessary for the CMIxxIDE!

         Non direct replacement but 100% functional 74LS461.

         GAL Table Rule 1 entries.
         But now the Q7 and Q5 outputs are swapped, this is not a direct replacement.
         Read the '74LS461 - Gal.pdf' how to use or how to change the print.

If you can get the GAL20XV10B see the "Pal Selection Table.jpg".
