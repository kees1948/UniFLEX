          You can use a GAL to replace the 74LS461 chip.


Rule 1: If you can get the 74LS461, use it.

Rule 2: GAL Table number 2 entries.
        Direct replacement voor de CPU09IDE card 74LS461,
        but not a 100% functional 74LS461 version.



         Non direct replacement but 100% functional 74LS461.

GAL Table number 1 entries.
But now the Q7 and Q5 outputs are swapped, this is not a direct replacement.
Read the '74LS461 - GAL.pdf'.


USE rule 1 or 2.



Some explanation about the 74LS461 in a GAL.

A full 74LS461 implementation in a GAL needs too many perms on Q5, Q6 and Q7.
Therefore, the Q outputs cannot be in the 74LS461 chip order.

HOWEVER on the CMIxxIDE pin-11 of the 74LS461 is connected to GND.
So all AND's with pin-11 low input, have no function and can be removed.
And all OR's with pin-11 high input, have no function and can be removed.
See the GALUx-461.PDS file and look at the /Q7 rule it says '; removed I1'.

This reduces the perm count so that the GAL is pin compatible with the 74LS461.
The GAL is 100% FUNCTIONALLY COMPATIBLE with a 74LS461 on the CMIxxIDE.


Please note that this GAL is only suitable as a replacement for the 74LS461 
in any other system if pin-11 is connected to GND.
