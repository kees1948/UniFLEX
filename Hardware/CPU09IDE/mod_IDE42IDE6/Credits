Our friend Kees de Jong spend some time creating
a step-by-step update plan to get your V1.1 board
modified to V2.0

Good soldering skills and some handy tools are preferred

His main drive for this update project was that he did not 
want to discard boards with the 41612ac connector and 
the 74LS461 chips that are not socket-ed.

Thank you Kees
