1)mod CS:
For the74HC161 : pin-3 (dA) to VCC I cut the pin as I have soldered
most chips directly in the board.

Cut trace to pin-1 of 74HC161. put pin-1 to VCC.
Cut trace to pin-9 and between pin-9 and pin-10
Put pin-10 to VCC
put pin-9 to R161-

Or mod CJ:
Remove socket
TOP side:
	isolate hole pin-3 from gnd (cut with surgical 15 blade)
	cut trace between pin-9, pin-10
	cut trace pin-1
	cut trace pin-9
	put trackwire from trace by pin-1 into hole pin-9
	put trackwire from trace by pin-9 into hole pin-10
BOTTUM side:
	isolate hole pin-3 from gnd (use big drill 5mm)

Place new socket and solder pin-3 on pin and hole, to fix the socket pin
Put wire between pin-3, pin-1 and pin-16

2)
And use other GAL pattern


Note: 
The photo's used the CJ modification,so you don't see the trace cuts.
And pin-3 is isolated from gnd and conncted on the bottum side to VCC.
The rest of the wires are on the top side under the socket, so you don't see them.
