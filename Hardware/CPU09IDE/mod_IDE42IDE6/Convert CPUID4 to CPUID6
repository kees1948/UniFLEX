Convert CPUID4 to CPUID6

First make the modifications V1.2 and V1.3

1)
TOP side:

cut trace pin-17 G4 between R5 and R6
cut trace pin-10 G4 between C7 and C10
cut trace pin-9  G2 between G2 and C13 (dual card mod.)

BOTTUM side:

cut trace pin-16 G2 between U2 and U10
cut trace pin-17 G2 between U2 and U10

cut trace pin-22 G3

wire pin-9  G2 to pin-16 U10 (dual card mod.)
wire pin-22 G3 to pin-3  G4
wire pin-8  G3 to pin-16 G4
wire pin-4  G3 to pin-13 G4

wire pin-15 G4 to pin-38 FC_40VF
wire pin-17 G4 to pin-37 FC_40VF

wire pin-28 FC_40VF to pin-30 FC_40VF

2)
remove R1 and R2 from gnd holes
wire R1 and R2 to Vcc C2
Or:
remove on TOP and BOTTUM gnd from the holes (5mm drill)
put R1 and R2 back in the holes
on BOTTUM side wire R1 and R2 to pin-14 U1.

3)
reprogram the 4 GAL's with IDE_GxB versions.

-

Dual CPU9IDE card:
reprogram G2 with IDE_G2C.JED

-

Optional add LED's:
drill holes next to R7 and R1, see the green O markers.
remove on TOP and BOTTUM gnd from the holes (5mm drill)
place R8 and R9 (use some glue) 
on BOTTUM side wire R8 and R9 to pin-14 U1

drill 4 holes for D1 and D2, See the green O markers.
remove on TOP and BOTTUM gnd from the holes (5mm drill)
place D1 and D2 (use some glue)
wire D1-a to R8
wire D2-a to R9
wire D1-k to pin-20 G1
wire D2-k to pin-7  G1

-

Optional add DACK- / ADEN- jumper:
cut trace, see V1.1 modification
glue a jumper on BOTTUM side next to FC-40VF
Or:
drill 3 holes, see the blue O markers.
remove on TOP and BOTTUM gnd from the holes (5mm drill)
glue a 3 pin jumper on the TOP side

wire pin-1 to the hole (DACK- trace)
wire pin-2 to pin-29 FC_40VF
wire pin-3 to pin-20 G1


Note:
Some wires are connected on Via holes to reduce crossings and shorten the wires.
