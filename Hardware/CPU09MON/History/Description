CPU09MON

Provides:
* up to 992KB of user RAM
* up to 8 KB of user (E)(P)ROM, in 2K pages F800-FFFF
* a serial console port, (HD63B50 running at 4MHz busclock with no waitstates) baud rates 19k2,9k6,4k8,2k4,1k2
* hardware BLACKHOLE and WHITEHOLE memory detection and generation
* central baudrate generator for the whole system, 1.2288MHz over the system bus
* 8 status LED's for kernel flagging, the 'LIGHTS' feature as coded in the kernel
* periodic timer interrupt, 100 Hz
* IO decoding for most devices in the area F000-F3FF
* dual interrupt vectors, depending on supervisor/user state

Description:
The CPU09MON card holds a special version of the UniBUG ROM, up to 1 MByte of static RAM, an ACIA for system console, a PIA that is
serving as system timer/control and for the LIGHTS feature. The card holds a 4.9152 MHz baud rate oscillator, a /4 signal is fed
over the backplane as common clock for other serial boards and it provides the 100 Hz signal for the system timer.
3 16V8 GAL's serve as glue logic. The board also holds the logic for the BLACKHOLE and WHITEHOLE memory blocks. In this system
BLACKHOLE reads as $3F and triggers a trap when accessed (read or write) in User mode. The WHITEHOLE memory is read-only and
reads as $00. The card format is Eurocard (160x100mm) and has a DIN41612 a-c connector.

I got the rev 1.0 of the MON board, populated it and tested it. Initially it would not work :-(. But after some serious
debugging it came out that the low bank of the 512x8 memory chip was faulty. It had an address line error inside.
After replacement the board works fine!. 

That makes me wonder if I need to revive the famous SWTPC pathalogic memory test version (ROM) for my system. 
It may avoid a lot of trouble...

I have uploaded a jumper description for this board and photo's. A last hint is, that if you don't use full hardware handshake
on the serial connector, jumper pin 7 and 8 somehow together. Otherwise the output may not appear at all.

The board is not very complicated.

2020-02-12: The CPU09MON is in a good shape. The capacitor (470P) [C15] over the resistor in the 1.MHz baudclock should better 
be 1 nF. If you experience weird characters with the CPU09SR4 characters, this change will solve that.
