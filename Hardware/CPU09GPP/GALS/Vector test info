Vector test on TL866II Plus. In Vector are the LGC files.


GPP_1            - Many inputs 2048 lines, but we can split it in 4 tests:

   GPP_1-P1a.lgc - equation tests, unused input pin's don't care state.
   GPP_1-P1b.lgc
   GPP_1-P1c.lgc
   GPP_1-P1d.lgc - full equation tests done.
                   Test: PAGESEL

GPP_1-P2x.lgc    - manipulated equations tests, unused input pin's don't care state.
                   Test: OEL_, CEL_, WEL_

GPP_2-P1.lgc    - full equations tests, unused input pin's don't care state.
                  Test: OER_, CER_, WER_, IOLED_, SEL1_, SEL2_, LCLIO_

GPP_2-P2.lgc    - full equations tests, unused input pin's don't care state.
                  Test: CPURES_, U4CE_, U5CE_

GPP_3.lgc       - full equations tests, unused input pin's don't care state.
