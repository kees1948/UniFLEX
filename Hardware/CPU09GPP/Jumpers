The CPU09GPP has a few jumpers.

/IRQ  /FIRQ    select /IRQ  J2

At ths moment the UniFLEX kernel does not process FIRQ type interrupts.
The dispatch table is present, but empty.

/MRDY       L1,L2

These are merely just to be (wire) jumpers. They should be on.
Their whole purpose is that you can cut /mrdy to either CPU is case of
hardware problems, without need to cut traces.
The /MRDY signals are used at both sides for arbitration when but CPU's
attempt to _write_ to the _same_ dual port RAM location.


P2 off       P1  and  P0 have no effect   [F]EXXX  memory page

C0  and  C1

These jumpers decode the address area the GPP is accessible at the OS side.

C0 off,  C1 off        [F]E000-[F]E3FF     (floppy interface)
C0 on ,  C1 off        [F]E400-[F]E7FF     (not assigned)
C0 off,  C1 on         [F]E800-[F]EBFF     (network interface)
C0 on ,  C1 on         [F]EC00-[F]EFFF     (assigned to RAM disk)


P2 on        P1  and  P0  define the absolute bus address page

P0 off,  P1 off        [F]8XXX
P0 on ,  P1 off        [F]9XXX
P0 off,  P1 on         [F]AXXX
P0 on ,  P1 on         [F]BXXX


GND, /NMI, VCC     J8

Can be used to apply a NMI on the local CPU. i.e. with the 09NMI board.

R5, R4, R7   

ONLY ONE of them should have 0 Ohm resistor. The location determines the 
interval for the on board interval timer (interrupt). This is provided
the components for this circuit are placed on the board. 

U9 should be present if the 1.2288 MHz is to be used on the popup board or
the local interval timer is needed. That includes R3, R6, C11, D3, D4.
U6, U7, U8 should be present for the interval timer to work.

R7:  3.3 mS
R4:  6.6 mS
R5:  13.2 mS
