2020-10-12:I made a pleasant discovery. With the implementation of 'unbiased' sectors in the flpdrvrof my kernel, all of a sudden compatibility between UniFLEX and Linux on diskette format comes within reach. Originally UniFLEX floppies/diskettes have biased sector numbering,that is the sector number on side 1 count upwards from the last number on side 0.Linux uses unbiased sector numbering as does MSDOS etc.I found out that my Linux program makeuffs also can be used to format a floppy on Linuxthat I can access under UniFLEX!So I created two specific versions: mkufflp1 and mkufflp12. The first one creates a 720KDouble Side, Double Density diskette, the second one creates a 1440K Double Side, High Density diskette. These tools setup the special markers in the SIR that tell UniFLEXabout the disk format.The other surprise was that 'fuse_uf /dev/sdd UF' mounts this UniFLEX diskette on UF, soI can exchange software now the most easy way.
