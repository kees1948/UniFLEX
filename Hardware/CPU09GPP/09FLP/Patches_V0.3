For the prototype version 0.3 there are 2 minor changes*  Array RA2, put wire between pin 5 and 7. (makes lower resistor for RAW READ DATA)*  cut trace between pin 3 of U4 and adjacent via. run wire from C2 (non resistor side) and pin 3 of U19 (7555)That's all. A newer revision wil have these fixed.
