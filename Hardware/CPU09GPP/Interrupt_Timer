The CPU09CPU in the recent versions has provisions for an interrupt timer.The interrrupt can be:* enabled* disabled* acknowledged, reset IRQOnly 2 (partial) decoded locations in the 8400-87FF address space (lclio)are used.Address 8400  'write', set interrupt enabled/disabledxxxxxxxx0       set timer interrupt offxxxxxxxx1       set timer interrupt onAddress 8400  'read', status bitsxxxxxxxx0       interrupt disabledxxxxxxxx1       interrupt enabled0xxxxxxxx       interrupt not pending   board IRQ not asserted1xxxxxxxx       interrupt pending       board IRQ assertedAddress 8401  'write', reset interrupt, board IRQ goes inactivexxxxxxxxx       bits are don't caredue to the simple decoding these locations repeat each 16 addressesin the 0x8400-0x87FF range. i.e. 8400=8410=8420.... etcThe interval time has only a few selections:3.3 mS  300 Hz          (R7)6.6 mS  150 Hz          (R4)13.2mS  75 Hz           (R5)select by placing ONE 0...100 Ohm resistor in the corresponding place. 2023-09-30 CS
