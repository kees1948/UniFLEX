 
The prototype version V0.2 has to have a minor modification

See photo 20200710_220522a.jpg in the top left corner,
cut the trace close to the via.

cut trace between pin 20 of G1 (U2) and the adjacent resistor array.
cut trace between pin 20 of G1 (U2) and pin 1 of J3.

attach the wires as on photo 20200710_220530a.jpg

The purpose for all this to free one GAL output for an intermediate
'term' for the addressing. So I discarded the Q signal from the bus 
and used that pin for PAGESEL2.
