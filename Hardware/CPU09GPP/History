The CPU09GPP provides:* local HD63C09 CPU at 4MHz clocks* 1Kx8 dual port RAM between host CPU and local CPU with interrupt flags and arbritration logic* up to 32KB of local RAM* up to 16KB of (E)EPROM* up to 1K Bytes of dedicated IO space (A0...A9)* local periodic timer interrupt circuitry (6.7, 13, 26 mS)* LED's which show host CPU access and local CPU access* local CPU can be individually reset from assigned bus pin (A3)* the CPU09GPP has it own address decoding for the system bus. (Page select for F8,F9,FA,FB or FE (default)) Cardselect 0...3* 40 pin IO expansion connector with local Data, Address and Control signals. Can handle DMA from appropriate IO devices.The schematic diagram is the 0.9 revision (final) of the board.(The photo's are taken from the proto board Rev 0.2.) <<<2021-08-16: added photo of a recent version.2020-09-29:As mentioned in the README file, the floppy interface works well. Maybe some minor corrections to be made, but in it's current state it is very usable.2020-10-26:Added the final board files, final GAL info. The silk texts for the delay times has been (wrongly) swapped between the lowestand the highest.....Firmware:For floppy, that sits in ../flp_cpu in the newer build treeFor Econet, that sits in ../ecn_cpu in the newer build tree
