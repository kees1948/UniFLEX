Description of the delay select jumpers.


The V1.0 board design allows for correction of SPI clock<=>data
timing to get the SPI hardware working properly.

When the board, as build, does not provide correct SPI operation,
this may be due to a timing mismatch between SPI data and clock.

When the board works first try, U1 can be ommitted.
U1 was added (74HC125) with J2 and J3.

J2[3]<->J2[2]     default, no delay, U1 may be absent for this
J2[2]<->J2[1]     extra ~10nS delay for SPI_CLK, U1 should be in.

J3[3]<->j3[2]     default, no delay, U1 may be absent for this
J3[2]<->J3[1]     extra ~10nS delay for SHCLK, U1 should be in.

Note that U1 must be placed whenever J2 or J3 are in the delay
setting!


(For the older board revisions, I recommend a 74HC125 piggy-backed
on top of one of the 74HC74 devices.

pin 1,2,3,4,5 can be all connected to VCC
pin 13,12 can be all connected to VCC
Pin 4 should be connected with GND
Pin 5 should be SPI_CLK
Pin 6 is now SPI_CLD  

I advice a trace cut in the CLK line near to the W5500. SPI_CLK is 
the signal output from G1 pin 23. SPI_CLKD is the signal that should
go to CLK of the W5500.)
