 
We all know Murphy in one way or another.

I had an encounter with his rules in the last days....

"Same components in the same conditions will not operate the same way"

I had build my first 09NET board let us call it 'board A'. It worked right
off the bat, no problems whatsoever.

Next I build the next board, let us call it 'board B'. Same as
above, it worked perfectly the same way.

Now I build 'board C', it sort of worked but transfer of larger files
in someway got them garbled, where the resulting size was smaller or
larger after finishing transfer. Not Good!

I did a LOT of testing, measurements, I even got that far that I replaced
ALL the components, mostly soldered directly in, by new ones but this time
socket-ed. After a long time I discovered that the QA output of my 74HC161
was of opposite polarity.............

After same thinking and fiddling, changing the circuit around U13,
I had board C working perfectly. QA timing back to normal.

So I decided to perform the changes also on 'board B', hell NO, it did not
work properly any longer.


So I expect to have a 'race' problem with timings in the design.

I pulled the board files.

I need to rethink the design a bit I expect. Building the board as
published may result in a perfectly working board, but with bad luck...

I keep you posted......
