CPU09US4

Provides:
    * up to 4 serial ports, HD63B50 at 4 MHz busclock with no wait states
    * each port has a programmable baudrate setting
      38k4,19k2,9k6,4k8,2k4,1k2,0k6,0k3
    * full interrupt capability
    * LED which signals on board selection
    * each port has an individual USB interface capability
        * with an USB-C interface module
        * with a micro-USB interface module
        * with USB<->TTL interface module
    * overall design is simular to that of the CPU09SR4

NOTE(!) when an input is layed out for an USB<->TTL interface and the port is NOT
connected, place a jumper over pins 2 and 3 of the data connector.

Else you may experience an Interrupt storm which will slow-down your system.
This is because there are no pull-up's on the receiver input lines.

The photo shows an example of input hardware layouts:
* SER1 has been provided with an USB_C input module
* SER2 has been provided with a micro-USB input module
* SER3 is set for USB<->TTL interface, note the jumper between 2 and 3 here.
* SER4 is set for USB<->TTL interface, BLACK = GND, 
                                       GREEN = data to ACIA(RX), USB(TX)
                                       WHITE = data from ACIA(TX, USB(RX))

* any port can be setup for any type of USB interface. Be aware that BOTH, 
  the ACIA (Uniflex) and the USB device (PC) should be set for the same baudrate!

With the UniBug monitor it is easy to check if you did the right selection, e
F000-F07F. You should see the MONitor ACIA and the PIA and the ACIA's on the SR4
board(s).
